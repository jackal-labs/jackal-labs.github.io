## Jackal Labs

> This is the website for Jackal Labs, a team of developers. We are **for hire** for projects great and small; on this site we provide an account of our interests and skills, as well as the services we can offer.

> Our interests and competencies cluster around backend work, predominantly with Python and its scientific stack, meaning data exploration, information extraction and retreival, visualisation, statistics, documentation systems, natural langauge processing, game design, and devops. We also have skills in frontend and sysadmin, and therefore can function as a full-stack development team for hire, with years of history as friends and collaborators.

### Our story

Our team came together over the past years at a cryptocurrency company called [Bitpanda](https://bitpanda.com). Together we comprised most of the Python/blockchain/backend team, resposible for anything the company did that interfaced with blockchains. We would make it possible to buy, sell and trade new currencies as they became more popular, and created highly secure and efficident protocols for batch processing customers' buy/sell orders for popular currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and various ERC20 tokens.

We were there from the earliest days of the company, and watched it expand to over one hundred employees. The company had some growing pains, and introduced various vew organisational structures to 'improve' the way we worked. Generally speaking, the group of us felt varying degrees of dissatisfaction with these changes, experiencing a shift away from trust and autonomy from upper management, toward a model where we reported multiple times a day to new layers of management, with on many occasions these employees not being developers or even crytocurrency enthusiasts themselves.

Around the end of 2017, we had built for ourselves a fantastic team of ten backend/blockchain developers, who we interviewed together, and enjoyed working alongside. However, because the changing structure and culture of our workplace in general had led to feelings of malaise within the team, we began to break apart. Within six months, three of us, myself included, decided to leave.

Steps were taken to address the problems we had raised with management, but the quality of working life continued to decline for the remaining members of the team. After around eight months more, with structural reform looking less and less likely, four more of the team members resigned at the same together.

Despite the issues we faced at our employer, we were unanimous in our affection for one another, and 

So, we've created a loose organisation, *Jackal Labs*, which we hope will allow us the ability to continue building high-quality tech products for growing businesses, research institutions, and to satisfy our own interests and passions, which often extend far beyond digital currency and straight Python.

### Jackal collaborators

As a lab, right now we are unfunded and unpaid, though all of us currently work elsewhere, in a number of European cities. We collaborate together on hobby projects, with a longer-term aim of establishing connections with early- to mid-stage startups and research projects, potentially providing services such as consultancy and software architecture design. Moreover, we are potentially able to be hired as a team. In comparison with the time and efforts associated with building

We aim to provide another service model, whereby a startup needing rapid development of a digital service is able to hire our team of skilled colleagues, part- or full-time, local and/or remote work, with a history of successful collaboration in a number of subfields. This can be done quickly, with a single contract. Under this model, you could have a full team of highly skilled, pre-socialised team members ready to begin development in a matter of a few short weeks, with only a single contract necessary.

At a project's conclusion, we are able to deliver comprehensive documentation and handover services, as well as the option of retaining a skeleton staff able to assist in hiring and training of a new, permanent team, who can maintain and potentially expand the system we have put in place.
